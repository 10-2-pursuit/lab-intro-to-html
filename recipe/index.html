<h2> Ingredients </h2>

<ul>    1. Eggs <br> 
        2. Macaroni Elbows <br>
        3. Evaporated Milk or Whole Milk <br>
        4. Butter <br>
        5. Cheese (Any Type You Desire I personally Love Colby Jack and Sharp Cheddar) <br>
        6. Seasonings (Roasted Garlic and Herbs, Onion Powder, Adobo, Creole Seasoning) <br>

    <p> Please do not feel any pressure using exact seasonings!</p>
    <p> While you are prepping for this dish please preheat your oven to 350 F</p>
</ul>

<h2> Directions </h2>

<ol> 1. Bring a pot of water to boil. <br>
     2. As soon as you see the water boil you can add salt or oil. This is added because you do not want the pasta to stick together. <br>
     3. Pour the Macaroni Elbows into the water and continue to stir. I like to stir periodically and then let it cook for a few minutes. Keep an eye on pasta it can get overcooked. <br>
     4. As soon as you see the Macaroni Elbows cooked, looking beautiful you have to strain the water from the pasta. Please be careful while holding the pot, make sure you use potholders for your protection. <br>
     5. Wash off the noodles and pour the Macaroni Elbows into a new pot. <br>
     6. Add butter to the Macaroni Elbows, please stir until you do not see any butter. I personally like to use half a stick of margarine. <br>
     7. Add seasonings to taste, for this particular recipe I like to use more Garlic and Herbs with Spices. <br>
     8. After you add the seasonings please continue to stir until you see the seasonings covering the noodles in its entirety. <br>
     9. In a separate bowl crack open 3-6 eggs dependning on your consistency. I love using 6 eggs, I stir them together using a fork and I add Parsley, Slap Ya Mama Seasoning(Yes! This is a real brand and it tastes <em> amazing!</em>) <br>
     10. Add eggs to Macaroni Elbows and continue to stir all together. <br>
     11. I like to use aluminum pans when I cook this dish but you can you use anyting you want to bake. Just make sure it is deep enough to contain all the Ingredients. <br>
     12. Add the Macaroni Elbows into the pan of your choosing.<br>
     13. Add cheese into the pan and continue to stir. I love Colby Jack it is my favorite type of cheese for this dish, sometimes Monterey Jack and Sharp Chedder. For the most part I like to use the block of cheese but if this is your first time making this dish I suggest shredded cheese. <br>
     14. Add evaporated milk or whole milk. This ingredient is truly your choice, I suggest you add slowly and make sure when you pour it is covering the noodles because it has to be put in the over over 350F. <br>
     15. If you are using a pan without a cover please use aluminum foil to cover the pan before you put it into the oven. <br>
     16. Let the dish bake for 30-45 minutes this is an estimate. Please watch your dish while it is in the oven and you should be able to smell your seasonings while it cooks it will fill up the kitchen. <br>

<p> <strong>PLEASE ENJOY! </strong></p>
