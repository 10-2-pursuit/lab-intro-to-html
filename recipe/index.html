        <h2>Outside Opinion (You may stop reading but just hear me out, please)</h2>
        <p>When it comes to this dish, it can be paired with anything and you can have it at any time. But....I truly believe that this bacon grilled cheese is best paired with an amazing tomato soup topped with some basil, especially on a cold or rainy day. </p>
